# Deep Learning & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository! This collection includes all the general projects I've completed throughout my learning journey in Deep Learning and Machine Learning. Each project showcases different concepts, techniques, and models that I have explored and implemented. The repository serves as a record of my progress and hands-on experience in these fields.

├── notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks with experiments and analysis
├── src/                  # Python scripts for models, preprocessing, etc.
├── results/              # Outputs such as plots or metrics
└── README.md             # Description and details of the project
```
